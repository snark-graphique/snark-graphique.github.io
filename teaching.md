Listed below are courses that I taught so far during olympiad trainings organzied 
by the mathematical society of Myanmar and short trainings given by the Euclidiad 
mathematics organization. All the slides are in English, but notes and videos 
are mostly in Burmese. I will be grateful to receive feedbacks and suggestions 
regarding my teaching, lecture-plans, typsetting, and basically everything teaching-oriented.

- [**MSM December Training (Combinatorics)**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/teaching/2023-12-28-msm-december-training.markdown %})  
*2023 December*  
A short training organized by the mathematical society of Myanmar (MSM) for 
senior (Grade 10-11) students qualified for Myanamar national olympiads (now called MOMC). 
Contents include recurrence relations, recursive algorithms, counting with bijections, and 
proving combinatorial identities.

- [**Intensive Training for 2022 Myanmar IMO Team (Combinatorics)**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/teaching/2022-06-30-imo-2022-training.markdown %})  
*2022 May - June*  
The name is self-explanatory. The content is just common problem solving techniques 
in olymmpiad combinatoircs such as the use of invariants, repeat-until-stuck algorithms, 
double counting and basic graph theory.

- [**Euclidiad Level 1 (Junior) Short Course in Combinatorics**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/teaching/2022-07-01-euclidiad-one-combi.md %})  
*2022 July*  
A very basic course on elementary counting oriented towards entry level olympiads 
such as AMC8/10, SASMO/SEAMO and junior level MOMC. This course covers standard material 
in elementary counting such as multiplication and addition principles in counting, permutations 
and combinations considered with or without repetitions. However, the problems are 
oriented more towards problem-solving rather than high school material.

- **Euclidad Level 1 (Junior) Short Course on Geometry**  
*2022 July*  
A very basic course on elementary Euclidean geometry oriented towards entry level olympiads 
such as AMC8/10, SASMO/SEAMO and junior level MOMC. This course covers basic concepts in 
Euclidean geometry with emphasis on computations. The contents include angles in polygons, 
length-chasing with right triangles, relations between area and length ratios.

- **Euclidad Level 2 (Senior) Short Course on Combinatorics and Number Theory**  
*2021 Janurary - February*

- **Intensive Training for 2020 Myanmar IMO Team**  
*2020 August*
