    I am a year 3 undergrad at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) studying mathematics. 
    I am currently hooked into combinatorics, and applications of analysis in combinatorics. 
    Please find my CV <a href="/files/heinta_CV.pdf"> here</a>.

    I am also into olympiad math, and I sure do enjoy teaching 
    young students problem-solving. 
    Outside of math, I enjoy wandering around the worlds of single-player 
    video games.
