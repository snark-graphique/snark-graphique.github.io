    I am a Masters student at the University of British Columbia (UBC). 
    I enjoy all-things-analysis and its connections with combinatorics. 
    <br>

    I am also into olympiad math, and I sure do enjoy teaching 
    young students problem-solving. 
    Outside of math, I enjoy exploring nature, cooking and platforming games.

    You can contact me at heinta[N]@gmail.com where you replace [N] with 
    the only palindrome year in 21st century.
