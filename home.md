    I am a year 4 undergraduate at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) studying mathematics. 
    I enjoy all-things-analysis and how this connects to combinatorial problems. 
    Please find my CV <a href="/files/heinta_CV.pdf"> here</a>.

    I am also into olympiad math, and I sure do enjoy teaching 
    young students problem-solving. 
    Outside of math, I enjoy running, cooking and platforming games.
