title: MSM December Training (Combinatorics)
---
<p>
    Listed below are courses that I have taught during olympiad trainings organzied 
    by the mathematical society of Myanmar and short trainings given by the Euclidiad 
    mathematics organization. All the slides are in English, but notes and videos 
    are mostly in Burmese. I will be grateful to receive feedbacks and suggestions 
    regarding my teaching, lecture-plans, typsetting, and basically everything teaching-oriented.

        <b>Lecture notes and slides</b>
        <ul>
        <li><i>Recurrence Relations:</i> 
        <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/MSMdec_recurrence.pdf">pdf</a> in Burmese, <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/MSMdec_recurrence_slides.pdf">slides pdf</a>, <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/01_recurrence_embedded.pptx">slides ppt</a><br>
        Covers the idea of recursion in combinatorics such as setting up recurrences, chromatic polynomials and recursive algorithms 
        such as merge-sort.
        </li>
        <li><i>Bijective Counting:</i> 
        <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/MSMdec_bijection.pdf">pdf</a> in Burmese (unfinished), <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/MSMdec_bijection_slides.pdf">slides pdf</a>, <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/02_bijection_embedded.pptx">slides ppt</a><br>
        Covers the usage of bijections to solve seemingly complicated counting problems and proving combinatorial identities using counting.
