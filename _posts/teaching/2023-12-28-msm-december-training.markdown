title: MSM December Training (Combinatorics)
---
<p>
    A short training organized by the mathematical society of Myanmar (MSM) for 
    senior (Grade 10-11) students qualified for Myanamar national olympiads (now called MOMC). 
    Contents include recurrence relations, recursive algorithms, counting with bijections, and 
    proving combinatorial identities.

        <li><i>Recurrence Relations:</i> 
        <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/MSMdec_recurrence.pdf">pdf</a> in Burmese, <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/MSMdec_recurrence_slides.pdf">slides pdf</a>, <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/01_recurrence_embedded.pptx">slides ppt</a><br>
        Covers the idea of recursion in combinatorics such as setting up recurrences, chromatic polynomials and recursive algorithms 
        such as merge-sort.

        <li><i>Bijective Counting:</i> 
        <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/MSMdec_bijection.pdf">pdf</a> in Burmese (unfinished), <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/MSMdec_bijection_slides.pdf">slides pdf</a>, <a href="/files/teaching/msm-december-training/02_bijection_embedded.pptx">slides ppt</a><br>
        Covers the usage of bijections to solve seemingly complicated counting problems and proving combinatorial identities using counting.
