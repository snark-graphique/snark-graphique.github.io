Here are the projects I have done in the past, or the ones that I am doing 
whether they are formally/informally or professional/personal. 

### The Capset Problem
*Supervisor - [Dr. Li Chun Che](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/charlesli)*  
  
This project is for the 2022-23 undergraduate research opportunity program (UROP) 
organized by the mathematics department of CUHK. 
As usual with undergraduate projects, I read (and presented) some literature regarding 
the problem of finding AP-free sets in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $(\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z})^n$. 
This included (but not limited to) reading the proofs of Roth's theorem using Szemerédi's 
graph regularity lemma, the exponential improvement of the capset problem in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ by Ellenberg-Gijwijt polynomial method, 
and some lower bound constructions for capsets in $(\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z})^n$ with special focus on the case $k = 3$. 
The following are some of the notes I have written for my presentations during the project:
- *Croot-Lev-Pach-Ellenberg-Gijwijt Bound on Capsets* [pdf](/files/projects/urop/introppt.pdf)
- *From Szemerédi's Regularity Lemma to Roth's Theorem* (still editing)
- *Some Generalizations of Roth's Theorem for Groups* [pdf](/files/projects/urop/roth-for-group.pdf)
- *Behrend's Construction of AP-free sets in $\mathbb{Z}$* [pdf](/files/projects/urop/behrend-construction.pdf)
- *Three Constructions of Capsets in $(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z})^n$* [pdf](/files/projects/urop/z4n-proof.pdf)
- *Final Presentation* [pdf](/files/projects/urop/urop-presentation.pdf)

### Short Reading Project on Ergodic Theory
*Supervisor - [Prof. Feng Dejun](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/djfeng)*  
  
During the above undergraduate research opportunity project, I was curious about the 
proof of Szemerédi's theorem for AP-free sets in $\mathbb{Z}$. 
With my current interest in exploring more analysis (and its applications to combinatorics), 
I am reading through [*Ergodic Theory: with a view towards Number Theory*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-85729-021-2) 
by Manfred and Thomas, under the supervison of [Prof. Dejun Feng](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/djfeng).

### COSINE Summer Research Exchange Program
*Supervisor - [Prof. Po Lam Yung](https://maths.anu.edu.au/people/po-lam-yung)*

To be updated


### မြန်မာနဲ့သင်္ချာ
  
I ocassionally write articles for the Burmese audience and post them on Facebook (aka Burmese google). 
These include several results that fascinated me when I first learned mathematics 
outside of the standard high school curriculum. See details on [မြန်မာနဲ့သင်္ချာ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link mmmath.md %}).

### YouTube
*Channel - [Snarky Math](https://www.youtube.com/@SnarkyMath)*  

I have created some YouTube videos in the past, the first one being due to [*The Summer of Math Exposition*](https://www.3blue1brown.com/blog/some1) 
hosted by 3Blue1Brown. I haven't posted in a while, but I do have some topics in mind for future videos. 
Maybe one day, when I am motivated for videos again, I will create more YouTube videos.
